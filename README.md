## How can I use it?
Briefly it's to easy
* run the python script :ok_hand:
* make sure that your word which you want to encrypt it be a one word like ````ROOT```` or ````HELLO```` not like this ````HELLO WORLD```` :ok_hand:
* make sure for the word should be uppercase ````ROOT```` not lowercase ````root```` :ok_hand:
* also be sure for the key's value should be an integer ! :ok_hand:

## Examples
Let's use key = 4
* ````ROOT```` => ````VSSX````
* ````HELLO```` => ````LIPPS````
* ````WORLD```` => ````ASVPH````
